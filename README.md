# Azran

**Azran** is a game FOSS project using PixiJS. It is heavily inspired by Chapatiz and Blablaland and tends to easily make game that resemble them. We indent to make our own fully animated avatars, and a coherent level design.

## Changelog

### 2018-04-12

Made this repo public.
We were actively working on an avatar system based on the `a` file used by several game engines. We're about to make a working avatar. This is the most difficult feature of this project.

See `docs/avatar.md` for more details about avatar breakdown.

### 2018-04-14

Now handling an avatar with multiple parts (such as hat, feet, ...) and animations (such as directions). 
We're currently working on a tiny chat system for demonstration.

### 2018-04-15

Tiny chat done. Now working on UI and room system, inspired by discord.
